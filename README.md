# dumbgrad - a proper micrograd ripoff

After 3 tries finally made a neural network (from scratch more or less)
and the final iteration copies Karpathy's micrograd, but I did change some 
things around for the sake of speed.

There are still loads of optimisations and improvements to be made
but i don't know how far will I go with this.
