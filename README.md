# nn-proof-of-concept

Making this public because convenience despite being incomplete

A pretty bad implementation that is intended for experiments.

Implemented in ruby because I felt like it.

Writing with matrices would be way faster and generally pretier, 
but defeats the purpose of a proof of concept
